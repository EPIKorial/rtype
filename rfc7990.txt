RFC 7990            Instructions to R-Type protocole       November 2016


1.	Introduction

	This Request for Comments (RFC) provides information about the
	R-Type protocole. The MegaMalin R-Type is a shoot them up video game
	playable up to four on the internet. First of all, each player must
	connect to the server before they can join a Room to find other
	players and finally be able to launch the game. If you read this RFC
	in front of us, you can ask F. Huet for have a chocolate. In this
	RFC you will find the entire protocol between the client and the
	server for the MegaMalin's R-Type game.
   
2.	Connection and lobby

	At the game start, it try to connect to the server. Once the
	connection is established, the server, offer you the possibility to
	create or join a room. When you are in a room and the players inside
	are ready, the actual game starts.

	2.1. TCP protocol

		The connection and the room system uses tcp protocol.
		The requests MUST uses csv formating.

	2.2. Connection
	
		To connect, the game MUST send a "connect" request.
		
		Request format :
		CONNECT,<PlayerNickname>

		The player nickname MUST use alphanumeric characters.

	2.3. Rooms list

		Once the client is connected, the server returns the list of all
		the avalaibles rooms. A room become unavalaible when the game
		starts.
		
		Response format:
		ROOM_LIST,<RoomName>,<PlayerNumber>

	2.4. Lobby

		In the lobby you can create a room or join an existing room.
		You can see all the avalaibles rooms and the number of players
		inside each of them.

		2.4.1. Room creation
		
			In the lobby, you can create a new room. You MUST specify a
			room name.

			Request format :
			ROOM_CREATE,<RoomName>
			
			The RoomName MUST use alphanumeric characters.

		2.4.2. Room join

			You can also choose a room from the avalaible list, and join
			it. The room's name MUST be specified.

			Request format : 
			ROOM_JOIN,<RoomName>

	2.5. Room joined

		When you try to create or join a room, the server sends back a
		response, that contains the status of your attempt, the name of
		the room, your personnal id (in the case it did not fail) and
		the room's port.
	
		Response format :
		ROOM_JOINED,<OK/KO>,<RoomName>,<YourID>,<Room'sPort>
	
	2.6. Room players

		When you enter a room, the client requests the name and the
		state of all the players inside.
	
		Request format:
		ROOM_PLAYERS,<PlayerNickname>,<IsReady>

	2.7. Room player list

		The server responds by a list of players.

		Response format:
		ROOM_PLAYER_LIST,<PlayerNickname>...

	2.8. Player is ready

		Once everything is setup, the client MUST notify the server that
		the client is ready.

		Request format :
		ROOM_READY,<PlayerNickname>

	2.9. Game start

		When all the players are ready, the server launch the game.
	
		Request format : 
		ROOM_START

3. R-Type Game Protocol:

	This is the specification of the Game Protocol from the game R-Type.
	It is used in order to send game data, such as, but not limited to :
	 - movements
	 - actions
	 - events
	 - object instanciations.

	This protocol is known as a binary protocol. The underlying protocol
	SHOULD be UDP, in regard to the performances expected.
	This protocol MUST use little endian order.

	3.1. Message Header

		Every message sent through this protocol MUST be precessed of
		the following header:

		Magic Number :
		 - It uses 1 byte.
		 - It MUST be 79.

		Size :
		 - It uses 2 bytes.
		 - It stores the size of the message (excluding this header).

		Checksum :
		 - It uses 1 byte.
		 - It MUST equal the sum of every bytes in the message.
		(exluding this header)

		Message Type :
		 - It uses 1 byte.
		 - It is used to encode the type of the message.

	3.2. Messages

		This is a list of the possible messages.

		3.2.1. Position Update

			This message describes a movement of a game object. Client
			side, this message MUST be sent when the player moves. If
			you're still reading at this point, you can ask for another
			chocolate. Server side, this message MUST be sent when any
			game object moves, and in order to validate a player's
			movement.

			It is encoded this way :

			ID :
			 - It uses 4 bytes.
			 - It is the ID of the game object moving.
			 - It MUST be a valid game object ID.

			Position X :
			 - It uses 4 bytes.
			 - It MUST be a floating point number in the IEEE 754
			   notation.

			Position Y :
			 - It uses 4 bytes.
			 - It MUST be a floating point number in the IEEE 754
			   notation.

		3.2.2. Client Messages :

			Here are client-to-server only messages

			3.2.2.1. Fire :

				This message describes a "fire" action.
				It is encoded this way :

				ID :
				 - It uses 4 bytes.
				 - It is the player ID.
				 - It MUST be a valid player ID.

				Position X :
				 - It uses 4 bytes.
				 - It MUST be a floating point number in the IEEE 754
				   notation.

				 - It uses 4 bytes.
				 - It MUST be a floating point number in the IEEE 754
				   notation.

				Bullet Type :
				 - It uses 2 bytes.
				 - It describes the type of bullet fired.
				 - A server receiving this packet with an unknown bullet
				   type SHOULD ignore it.

		3.2.3. Server Messages :

			Here are server-to-client only messages.

			3.2.3.1. Instantiation :

				This message describes the instanciation of a new game
				object.
				It is encoded this way :

				ID :
				 - It uses 4 bytes.
				 - It is the game object ID.
				 - It MUST NOT be an ID already used by an active game
				   object.

				Position X :

				   notation.

				Position Y :
				 - It uses 4 bytes.
